# PFE

This README document introduces the end-of-study project by Laëtitia Cabrol and Bouchet Inès. The purpose of this project is to reproduce, in an accessible manner, communication between a drone and a robot.
We drew inspiration from what was accomplished with the Perseverance drone and the Ingenuity robot on Mars.

Detailed instructions for reproducing this project are available in the Robot and Drone branches.
